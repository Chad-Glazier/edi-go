// Arrow is a program that was created by Martin Müller and Theodore Tegos,
// described in their paper "Experiments in Computer Amazons." They describe
// two versions of Arrow, one which is non-selective (no move ordering) and
// another which is selective (a beam search where moves are ordered by the
// same evaluation function used for leaf nodes). This implementation
// is non-selective. That is, it's just normal alpha-beta search which uses
// QMinDist to evaluate leaf nodes.
